# **Description**: 

This project is a work-in-progess example of a full-stack banking application. Right now, it has no security, and only basic email/password authentication. Its primary purpose is to help me learn to code and to demostrate my growing skill. It was my final capstone project for the MITxPRO Professional Certificate in Coding. All images and branding is original artwork designed by Michelle Howa 2024. 

# **Installation and Usage**: 

To install and run this project, clone this repository and download the files. You will have to set up your own database and replace the value of const URL with your own connection string. You must also install the dependencies on your local machine before running this project (npm install in terminal) and then you can get it running locally but using the node index.js terminal command.

# **Technology used and Dependencies**: 

CORS, Express, LowDB and Mongo.

# **Upcoming Features**: 

As I continue improving this project, I would like to add Firebase Oauth, ensure my app has mobile functionality as well as browser, refine the log-in logic to account for multiple concurrent users, enact an automatic logout functionality due to inactivity, and add logic to prevent overdraft. I also would like to improve the design of the site in order to look more sleek and professional.
